# zenkey-build

Claude Code loads this file when working in `zenkey-build/`; the root `CLAUDE.md` is the index.

## v1

v1's `zenkey-build` (0.11.x on crates.io) is the `v1` branch's, and that branch's
`CLAUDE.md` describes it. Nothing below applies to it.

## zk2

- **`zenkey-build/`** 0.20.0 (MIT, unpublished; v1's `zenkey-build` 0.11.x
  is the `v1` branch's, and no member of `main` uses it) is zk2's codegen
  (#611, FI; the design is `docs/zk2/codegen.md`). A consumer's build
  script runs `zenkey-model`'s lints and the history's compatibility gate
  (breaking fails, review warns), embeds each bundle as `zenkey-model` builds
  it, and generates one module per interface: prost types from the bundles'
  own descriptor sets (no `protoc`), typify types or a name hint for JSON
  Schema (`check_schema` keeps a hinted type and its schema in step), and
  `Handlers`/`Api` traits with `Server`/`Consumer`/`Client`/`Fleet` over
  `zenkey::typed`. `contract_crate(true)` puts the runtime items behind a
  `zenoh` feature. Its fixtures are workspace members:
  `zenkey-build/fixtures/codegen-test` (the walkthrough and tcgui contracts,
  on a bus and with an `Api` double) and `fixtures/contract-crate` (no zenoh
  by default).
