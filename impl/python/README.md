# zk2py: the second implementation of the zk2 spec

zk2py is an independent Python implementation of the **static half** of the
zk2 core specification, plus the **first slice of its live half** (issue
#609).
The live slice covers presence, descriptors and contract retrieval; see
"The live half" below. It exists to test a claim the spec
makes about itself (`spec/core.md`, preamble): an implementation in any
language can be built from `spec/` alone, without reading the Rust
reference.

It was written from `spec/` (prose, schemas, fixtures, scenarios) and
`examples/zk2/` only. It never read `zenkey-model/`, the other Rust crates
or `docs/zk2/`. Where `spec/` was not enough, the gap is recorded in
[`SPEC-FINDINGS.md`](SPEC-FINDINGS.md). That file is as much the
deliverable as the passing runner.

## Running it

From the repository root:

```bash
just py-conformance
```

The recipe runs `impl/python/bootstrap.py`, then the runner. It:
1. creates `target/py-venv` with `python3 -m venv --without-pip`, which
   works where `ensurepip` is missing (Debian/Ubuntu without
   `python3-venv`);
2. downloads a pinned, sha256-checked `pip` wheel and installs pip into the
   venv by running pip from its own wheel;
3. installs [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt), with exact versions;
4. uses `protoc` from `PATH` if it reports `libprotoc 3.21.12`. Otherwise it
   downloads the pinned, sha256-checked protoc 21.12 release archive
   (linux x86_64) into the venv;
5. runs `python -m zk2py.conformance spec/conformance`, with
   `ZK2PY_PROTOC` naming that compiler.

The bootstrap uses only the standard library and needs no sudo. It reruns
quickly: the venv, pip and the requirements are reused when they are
unchanged. Python 3.11 or later is required, for `tomllib`.

To run it by hand once the venv exists:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=impl/python ZK2PY_PROTOC=/usr/bin/protoc \
  target/py-venv/bin/python -m zk2py.conformance spec/conformance [--family contracts]
```

The runner prints a pass/fail count per family, then every failure with its
case name. It exits with:
- **0** when everything passes;
- **1** when any case fails;
- **2** when it could not run: a missing directory, a broken fixture file,
  or no usable protoc.

## What it covers

| Family | Spec | Module | What is checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| keys | §1.1, §1.2 | `keys`, `lexical` | parse every key in `keys.json`, refuse the others, and build each accepted key back to the same string |
| slugs | §1.4 | `slug` | slug and unslug, round trips, and refusal of non-canonical chunks |
| templates | §2.2 | `templates` | match, then rank, with unslugged bindings |
| contracts | §9.1–§9.5, App. D | `contract`, `schemas`, `shape`, `protoc`, `jcs` | the exact sorted codes, the canonical JCS bytes and the fingerprint of every fixture. The protobuf well-known types and the five `e000-toml11-*` cases (0.4) are included. |
| sets | §9.2 | `sets` | E035, E036 |
| bundles | §9.6 | `bundle` | the twelve verification steps and their tags. `seed.toml` also **builds** to `valid.bundle.json` byte for byte. |
| history | §9.7 | `history` | `[at, tag]` per history root |
| descriptors | §3.3 | `descriptor` | the D codes, against `descriptors/contracts/nav.v2.toml`. That contract's fingerprint, computed here, is the `sha256:fea2…` the fixtures expect. |
| errors | §5.2 | `envelope`, `cbor` | JSON, CBOR and protobuf envelopes, and the refusal tags |
| compat | §9.7, §9.8 | `compat` | **all 87 cases** (spec 0.5), evaluated through `compat/README.md`'s one-resource wrapper: §9.8's six tables, the JSON Schema and protobuf rules, `same_revision`, and the FULL_TRANSITIVE cases (with each pairwise `against`). |
| examples | §9.6–§9.8 | | Every `examples/zk2/**/<name>.v<major>.toml`: loads with **no finding at all**, W107 included; its built bundle verifies; it is published in `examples/zk2/.history`, **byte-identical** to the bundle zk2py builds; it is `compatible` with its history. `examples/zk2/.history` passes the §9.7 check. |

The result at the time of writing:

```text
keys           55 passed     0 failed
slugs          42 passed     0 failed
templates      11 passed     0 failed
contracts      96 passed     0 failed
sets            4 passed     0 failed
bundles        24 passed     0 failed
history        10 passed     0 failed
descriptors    36 passed     0 failed
errors         38 passed     0 failed
compat         89 passed     0 failed
examples       97 passed     0 failed
total         502 passed     0 failed
```

The figures are against `core.md` 0.6.
- Amendment 0.5 resolved F-01 to F-55, and 0.6 resolved F-56 to F-63.
- 0.5 decided 13 of zk2py's guesses the other way, and 0.6 three more.

zk2py now follows the stated rules; `SPEC-FINDINGS.md` says, per finding,
how.

**The classifier since 0.3.** Against 0.2, zk2py classed every change §9.8
did not list as review. 0.3 lists them, so zk2py now follows the tables,
and its reasons carry the reference rule names (`explicit_set`,
`reserved_reused`, …). Twelve earlier guesses changed:

| Change | 0.2 guess | 0.3 rule |
|---|---|---|
| required → optional | review | breaking |
| a required resource added | review | breaking |
| a template parameter's type changed | review | breaking |
| the payload or attachment encoding changed | review | breaking |
| best_effort → reliable | review | compatible |
| `fanout` forbidden → allowed | review | compatible |
| `replies` many → one | review | compatible |
| a role removed | review | compatible |
| a role required → optional | review | compatible |
| `deprecated` added | review | compatible |
| a raw `media_param` changed | breaking | review |
| `items` toggled between absent, `true` and `false` | breaking | compatible |

Resources are still paired by template, not "by kind token and template",
because the explicit rows need it (F-40).

## The live half (first slice)

```bash
just py-live
```

The recipe reuses the bootstrap, builds the Rust owner example
(`cargo build -q -p zenkey --example owner`, a no-op once built), then
runs `python -m zk2py.live_interop`. The owner is used as a black box,
through its documented contract only.

The runner makes two owner runs:
- `nav.v2`;
- `camera.v1`, `zs.snmp.v1` and zk2py's own `interop/zk2py_probe.v1.toml`.

In each run, zk2py connects as a client and acts on presence, not on the
owner's `ready` line. It checks:
- **Presence (§8.1, §8.2):** one instance token, and one interface token per
  interface. Each token's `<fp16>` comes from the fingerprint zk2py computes
  from the TOML.
- **The descriptor (§3.3):** one reply on the instance key, no D code
  against the contracts, the expected interfaces with zk2py's fingerprints,
  minor, token and capabilities, and every contract-declared role (R3).
- **Retrieval (§8.4):** every bundle, verified against the descriptor's
  fingerprint and byte-identical to zk2py's own build.
- **Retrieval failures:** an unheld revision is unavailable after
  `BestMatching` then `All`. A corrupt nearest holder (a queryable zk2py
  declares) is refused while the valid bundle is accepted, and only corrupt
  holders leave the contract unavailable.
- **Presence at scale (presence.md §4):** 2,000 extra tokens, listed in
  full while a liveliness subscriber is held.
- **Shutdown:** closing the owner's stdin makes it exit 0.

Since 0.5, the runner also checks what §3.2, §3.3, §8.1 and §8.4 now
state:
- the descriptor reply carries no timestamp and no attachment;
- `profiles` is the union of the contracts' `uses`;
- unbound roles are listed with `bindings: []` and `params: {}`;
- no member token while the owner publishes nothing;
- each holder answers one `application/json` reply;
- a third owner run, on `thruster.v1`, whose required role is unbound,
  must not start.

Every wait is the 1 s that §8.1 gives a conformance run.

**State, operations, and being an owner (0.6).**
- `zk2py.live.get_state` makes a state GET per S4: target `All` and
  consolidation `Latest`. It returns current replies with their stamps, or
  silence.
- `zk2py.live.call` makes a call: `BestMatching` (O1), or `All` for a
  fan-out (O2), with consolidation `None`. It returns a value, a decoded
  §5.2 envelope, a transport error, or silence (O5).
- `zk2py.owner.Owner` is a minimal owner, a router or a client of one. It
  brings itself up in §8.2's order: a stamped raw state value (S1, S2),
  parameterless operations answered per O1–O3 (echo, a JSON operation,
  `app` refusals), the descriptor and bundle holders, then its tokens. It
  refuses to start with an unbound required role (§3.2).

The runner adds a third Rust-owner run, on `interop/zk2py_echo.v1.toml`,
whose state zk2py GETs and whose operations it calls. It also adds two
zk2py-owner runs:
- one read by zk2py's own client and by the Rust `consume` example (three
  times: echo, the protobuf `app` refusal, the JSON `invalid_request`);
- the refusal of presence.md §2 step 4, watched through a router of the
  runner's own with a control (`interop/zk2py_needs.v1.toml`).

Result: `live interop: 113 passed, 0 failed`. Exit codes are as for the
static runner.

**§8.1's handler rule in zenoh-python.**
- Every liveliness GET passes a `zenoh.handlers.Callback`, whose callback
  only appends to a list and whose drop function marks completion.
  zenoh-python has no unbounded channel, so a callback is the only
  compliant handler.
- The tool's session holds no bounded subscriber. Measured: a bounded,
  undrained subscriber starves even a callback GET (F-47).
- A GET that ends at its timeout rather than at the final reply is
  reported as possibly incomplete.

**§8.4 in zenoh-python.**
- Target `BestMatching`, then `All`.
- Consolidation `None`, so that each reply can be verified as it arrives.
  zenoh's default (`Auto`, which is `Latest` here) delivers one reply, at
  completion, and can drop the valid one (F-50).
- An unbounded queue fed by a callback; the first reply that verifies is
  accepted.

The live findings are F-46 to F-55 in `SPEC-FINDINGS.md`.

## What it does not cover

- **The rest of the live half:**
  - archives and alignment (§4.4);
  - deletes and tombstones (S3);
  - clocks beyond minting (S7's drift);
  - fan-out and many-reply operations (O2's caller side beyond refusal, O6);
  - serving roles (§6);
  - constrained faces (§8.5);
  - the scenarios other than presence.md, retrieval.md and parts of
    state.md and operations.md.

  zk2py's owner serves parameterless raw state and parameterless
  operations only.
- **Building bundles with extras.** The spec names no source for the
  documents `views.document` references (F-26). The builder refuses such a
  contract, as the reference builder does. Verification of extras is
  implemented.
- **A TOML 1.1 parser.** §9.1 (0.4) makes 1.1-only syntax E000, and
  `tomllib` is a strict TOML 1.0 reader that refuses all five constructs.
  zk2py probes the reader at load and refuses to run on a `tomllib` that
  reads 1.1 (F-41).
- **W107** runs only on request (`load_contract(..., check_file_name=True)`),
  as the fixtures load without it. The examples family turns it on.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Python | ≥ 3.11 | `tomllib` (TOML 1.0) |
| `rfc8785` | 0.1.4 | RFC 8785 (JCS) bytes. It refuses integers outside ±(2^53−1) and non-finite floats, which matches §9.5's restrictions. |
| `protobuf` | 6.33.5 | parsing `FileDescriptorSet`s, for the classifier and the §9.7 identity. It never produces artifact bytes. |
| protoc | 3.21.12 | artifact bytes (§9.4). §9.5 "Portability" says the protobuf fixtures assume protoc 3.21.12 with `--include_imports` and without source info. |
| pip | 25.2 | installed into the venv from its own wheel |
| `eclipse-zenoh` | 1.10.1 | the live half. zk2 is specified against Zenoh 1.10.1 (§0). The abi3 manylinux x86_64 wheel is used. |

**Why the system protoc rather than `grpcio-tools`.** The spec pins the
compiler, not a Python package. `grpcio-tools` bundles whatever protoc its
grpc release vendored. The releases of the protoc 3.21 era (1.51 to 1.54,
which pin `protobuf>=4.21.6,<5`) ship wheels only up to CPython 3.11. This
host runs 3.13, and Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.12. The system protoc 3.21.12
here, and the pinned release archive elsewhere, reproduce every fixture id.
That includes the well-known types, whose bytes depend on the `.proto`
sources the compiler ships (F-14).

**Strictness that comes from the spec, not from the libraries:**
- Python's `json` accepts duplicate members and `NaN`; `jcs.loads` refuses
  both.
- `tomllib` accepts integers beyond 64 bits; the contract reader refuses
  them, as TOML 1.0 requires (F-16).
- JSON Schema's `format` is only an annotation; the shape checker asserts
  `uint32`/`uint64` (F-17).

The JSON schemas are read from `spec/` at run time (`shape.py`), not copied.
So the E000 and D000 checks follow the published schema files exactly.
