# zk2py: the second implementation of the zk2 spec

zk2py is an independent Python implementation of the **static half** of the
zk2 core specification (issue #609). It exists to test a claim the spec
makes about itself (`spec/core.md`, preamble): an implementation in any
language can be built from `spec/` alone, without reading the Rust
reference.

It was written from `spec/` (prose, schemas, fixtures, scenarios) and
`examples/zk2/` only. It never read `zenkey-model/`, the other Rust crates
or `docs/zk2/`. Where `spec/` was not enough, the gap is recorded in
[`SPEC-FINDINGS.md`](SPEC-FINDINGS.md). That file is as much the
deliverable as the passing runner.

## Running it

From the repository root:

```bash
just py-conformance
```

The recipe runs `impl/python/bootstrap.py`, then the runner. It:
1. creates `target/py-venv` with `python3 -m venv --without-pip`, which
   works where `ensurepip` is missing (Debian/Ubuntu without
   `python3-venv`);
2. downloads a pinned, sha256-checked `pip` wheel and installs pip into the
   venv by running pip from its own wheel;
3. installs [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt), with exact versions;
4. uses `protoc` from `PATH` if it reports `libprotoc 3.21.12`. Otherwise it
   downloads the pinned, sha256-checked protoc 21.12 release archive
   (linux x86_64) into the venv;
5. runs `python -m zk2py.conformance spec/conformance`, with
   `ZK2PY_PROTOC` naming that compiler.

The bootstrap uses only the standard library and needs no sudo. It reruns
quickly: the venv, pip and the requirements are reused when they are
unchanged. Python 3.11 or later is required, for `tomllib`.

To run it by hand once the venv exists:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=impl/python ZK2PY_PROTOC=/usr/bin/protoc \
  target/py-venv/bin/python -m zk2py.conformance spec/conformance [--family contracts]
```

The runner prints a pass/fail count per family, then every failure with its
case name. It exits with:
- **0** when everything passes;
- **1** when any case fails;
- **2** when it could not run: a missing directory, a broken fixture file,
  or no usable protoc.

## What it covers

| Family | Spec | Module | What is checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| keys | §1.1, §1.2 | `keys`, `lexical` | parse every key in `keys.json`, refuse the others, and build each accepted key back to the same string |
| slugs | §1.4 | `slug` | slug and unslug, round trips, and refusal of non-canonical chunks |
| templates | §2.2 | `templates` | match, then rank, with unslugged bindings |
| contracts | §9.1–§9.5, App. D | `contract`, `schemas`, `shape`, `protoc`, `jcs` | the exact sorted codes, the canonical JCS bytes and the fingerprint of every fixture. The protobuf well-known types are included. |
| sets | §9.2 | `sets` | E035, E036 |
| bundles | §9.6 | `bundle` | the twelve verification steps and their tags. `seed.toml` also **builds** to `valid.bundle.json` byte for byte. |
| history | §9.7 | `history` | `[at, tag]` per history root |
| descriptors | §3.3 | `descriptor` | the D codes, against `descriptors/contracts/nav.v2.toml`. That contract's fingerprint, computed here, is the `sha256:fea2…` the fixtures expect. |
| errors | §5.2 | `envelope`, `cbor` | JSON, CBOR and protobuf envelopes, and the refusal tags |
| compat | §9.7, §9.8 | `compat` | **all 47 cases**, evaluated: the contract table, JSON Schema payloads, protobuf payloads (with `same_revision`), and the FULL_TRANSITIVE cases (with each pairwise `against`). |
| examples | — | | every `examples/zk2/**/<name>.v<major>.toml` loads with **no finding at all**, W107 included, and its built bundle verifies. Every `.history` directory under `examples/zk2/` would pass the §9.7 check; none exists at this revision. |

The result at the time of writing:

```text
keys           51 passed     0 failed
slugs          42 passed     0 failed
templates      10 passed     0 failed
contracts      59 passed     0 failed
sets            3 passed     0 failed
bundles        17 passed     0 failed
history         7 passed     0 failed
descriptors    26 passed     0 failed
errors         24 passed     0 failed
compat         47 passed     0 failed
examples       48 passed     0 failed
total         334 passed     0 failed
```

`core.md` §0 says that no implementation checks the `compat/` expected
values yet. zk2py checks every one and agrees with all of them, using its
own reading of §9.8 (SPEC-FINDINGS F-29 to F-36).

## What it does not cover

- **The live-bus half:** presence and tokens, state GET, operations, being
  an owner, archives, contract retrieval, and everything in
  `spec/scenarios/`. It needs a Zenoh session, and is a later phase.
- **Building bundles with extras.** The spec names no source for the
  documents `views.document` references (F-26). The builder refuses such a
  contract, as the reference builder does. Verification of extras is
  implemented.
- **The TOML 1.1 lint** that §9.1 says is owed. `tomllib` is a strict TOML
  1.0 reader, so a 1.1-only contract is E000 here (F-16).
- **W107** runs only on request (`load_contract(..., check_file_name=True)`),
  as the fixtures load without it. The examples family turns it on.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Python | ≥ 3.11 | `tomllib` (TOML 1.0) |
| `rfc8785` | 0.1.4 | RFC 8785 (JCS) bytes. It refuses integers outside ±(2^53−1) and non-finite floats, which matches §9.5's restrictions. |
| `protobuf` | 6.33.5 | parsing `FileDescriptorSet`s, for the classifier and the §9.7 identity. It never produces artifact bytes. |
| protoc | 3.21.12 | artifact bytes (§9.4). §9.5 "Portability" says the protobuf fixtures assume protoc 3.21.12 with `--include_imports` and without source info. |
| pip | 25.2 | installed into the venv from its own wheel |

**Why the system protoc rather than `grpcio-tools`.** The spec pins the
compiler, not a Python package. `grpcio-tools` bundles whatever protoc its
grpc release vendored. The releases of the protoc 3.21 era (1.51 to 1.54,
which pin `protobuf>=4.21.6,<5`) ship wheels only up to CPython 3.11. This
host runs 3.13, and Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.12. The system protoc 3.21.12
here, and the pinned release archive elsewhere, reproduce every fixture id.
That includes the well-known types, whose bytes depend on the `.proto`
sources the compiler ships (F-14).

**Strictness that comes from the spec, not from the libraries:**
- Python's `json` accepts duplicate members and `NaN`; `jcs.loads` refuses
  both.
- `tomllib` accepts integers beyond 64 bits; the contract reader refuses
  them, as TOML 1.0 requires (F-16).
- JSON Schema's `format` is only an annotation; the shape checker asserts
  `uint32`/`uint64` (F-17).

    keys.py           §1.1      the five key forms
    templates.py      §2.2      templates, shapes, resolution, overlap
    jcs.py                      strict JSON, RFC 8785, sha256 ids, §9.5 restrictions
    shape.py                    checks documents against contract/descriptor.schema.json
    protoc.py         §9.4      protoc invocation, well-known types
    schemas.py        §7.3 §9.4 artifacts, the subset, $ref, type references
    contract.py       §9.1–§9.5 lints, defaults, canonical form, fingerprint
    sets.py           §9.2      E035, E036
    bundle.py         §9.6      build, verify
    history.py        §9.7      the history check
    descriptor.py     §3.3      the D codes
    cbor.py, envelope.py §5.2   the error envelope
    compat.py         §9.7 §9.8 the classifier, retention identity
    conformance.py              the runner
```

The JSON schemas are read from `spec/` at run time (`shape.py`), not copied.
So the E000 and D000 checks follow the published schema files exactly.
